Title: Debug Mode Odoo Extension - Unleashing the Power of Navigation

Introduction:

We are excited to present our latest Odoo extension - the Debug Mode Odoo Extension, designed to enhance your navigation experience in both the Odoo Community and Enterprise versions. Debug Mode is a powerful feature that allows developers and administrators to gain deeper insights into the system's behavior, identify potential issues, and optimize their Odoo instance for maximum performance. With this extension, we aim to make the process of debugging more accessible and user-friendly, enabling users to unleash the full potential of their Odoo system.
